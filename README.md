# SnakeGameAI
The whole idea is that you and the computer can play snake next to eachother, the computer is going to be optimized for completing the game as fast as possible without dying. I am going to be using the [Hamiltonian Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path). Either you beat the computer to winning by taking shortcuts it doesn't know how to, or you lose.
